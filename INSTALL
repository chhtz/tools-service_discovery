How to patch and buid avahi:
1. Clone the avahi-git-repository with
 
    	git clone git://git.0pointer.de/avahi.git

   and change to the avahi-folder.

2. Check out the tagged official release point 0.6.25 with 

     	git checkout v0.6.25

3. Apply the patches with
	
	git apply avahi_custom_ttl_patch_avahiver_0_6_25.patch

   Note: Open avahi_loopback_patch_avahiver_0_6_25.patch in a text browser
	 and add the changes manually. 

4. Run 'autogen.sh'.

5. Configure with 

	./configure --disable-manpages --disable-mono

6. Build with './make'

7. Optional: Create the folder 'doc-pak' and copy all
   docs/README/INSTALL/etc. to that folder.

8. Install with 'checkinstall'.

	Note: 
	checkinstall can be installed via 'apt-get checkinstall'.
	As a preparation you will be asked for a deb-description and -name 
	and you can change general informations. 
	Afterwards checkinstall will create a debian packet which will be 
	used for installation.
	This allows a simple removal with 'dpkg -r avahi' if needed.
